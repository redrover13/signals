    "Placeholder files created: .env.template, .ai_config.toml.",
    "Code reorganized: apps/web content moved to apps/frontend-agents (though apps/web was empty), libs/gcp content moved to libs/utils/gcp-auth, libs/agents/src/tools.ts recreated and moved to libs/agents/gemini-orchestrator/src/lib/tools.ts, libs/mcp content (mcp.service.ts, clients, config, utils) moved to libs/agents/gemini-orchestrator and libs/utils/api-clients/monitoring.",
    "Old directories removed: apps/web, libs/gcp, libs/mcp.",
    "NX tags configured for all new apps and libs (scope:frontend, scope:backend-app, scope:backend-lib, scope:infra, type:ui, type:api, type:data, type:util, type:agent, type:iac, type:workflow).",
    "Architectural documentation created: ARCHITECTURE.md with narrative, ASCII diagram, and component list.",
    "AI assistance documentation created: COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md, BEST_PRACTICES.md (updated with test tagging), and .kilocode/rules/kilocode-config.md.",
    "CI/CD pipeline designed: .github/workflows/ci.yml created with linting, testing, type-checking, Terraform plan/apply, and deployment steps.",
    "Qodo agent files scaffolded: qodo.toml files created in src/lib for each agent library.",
    "Security and QA integration: SAST included in CI/CD, Secret Manager mentioned in architecture, test tagging guidance added to best practices."

  "remainingSteps": [
    "Manual migration of existing code from apps/api, apps/agents, and apps/event-parser into the new cloud-functions structure. This requires detailed understanding of their current logic and how it maps to the new microservice boundaries.",
    "Implementation of actual logic within the newly scaffolded libraries (e.g., bq-agent, looker-agent, etc.).",
    "Populating Terraform modules with actual HCL code for GCP resource provisioning.",
    "Configuring Google Cloud Secret Manager with necessary secrets (GCP_PROJECT_ID, GCP_WIF_PROVIDER, GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT, etc.).",
    "Setting up actual Looker embedding/configuration in the looker-dashboards app.",
    "Implementing dbt models and schemas within the libs/data-models libraries.",
    "Setting up actual CI/CD environments and secrets in GitHub/GCP.",
    "Implementing the actual deployment logic for Vertex AI Agents (currently a placeholder in CI/CD)."

  "suggestedNext": [
    "Review the refactored codebase and ensure all dependencies are correctly resolved and imports are updated.",
    "Begin implementing the core logic for each new application and library, focusing on one module at a time.",
    "Develop comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for all new and migrated components.",
    "Set up a local development environment for each new application to verify functionality.",
    "Conduct a thorough security review of the new architecture and implemented security measures.",
    "Iteratively refine the CI/CD pipeline based on real-world deployment experiences."
