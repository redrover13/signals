## Overview

This pull request merges the comprehensive `integration-main-final` branch into `main`. This integration branch consolidates several critical feature and improvement branches that have been systematically merged and tested together to ensure full compatibility and stability.

## Included Branches

- ✅ **nx-workspace-fixes**: Improved NX workspace configuration and TypeScript infrastructure
- ✅ **issue-42-perf-optimization**: Performance optimizations including lodash-es migration and Vite config improvements 
- ✅ **pr-45-nx-workspace-fixes**: Additional workspace improvements and GCP auth modules
- ✅ **pr-46-performance-optimization**: Enhanced signal library performance and better type safety
- ✅ **RAG Support**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation support in the Gemini Orchestrator

## Key Improvements

### RAG Support
- Added RAG client interface and default implementation
- Updated orchestrator to initialize RAG client
- Added methods for routing to RAG
- Added streaming support for RAG responses
- Updated routing logic to detect RAG-related queries

### Performance Enhancements
- Migrated from lodash to lodash-es for better tree-shaking
- Optimized Vite configuration with improved chunk splitting
- Enhanced signal library implementation for more efficient state management
- Improved React rendering optimizations

### Developer Experience
- Added TypeScript project references for faster builds
- Improved module resolution settings
- Enhanced path mappings in tsconfig
- Better error handling and diagnostic tools

### Security & Infrastructure
- Added specialized GCP auth modules for different services
- Enhanced authentication flows
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added MCP integration enhancements with better error handling
- Improved server management

### Documentation
- Updated centralized agents.md
- Transitioned from separate instruction files to a unified documentation approach
- Added data governance rules for Memory Bank
- Added comprehensive documentation for signals usage
- Created migration guides for updating older components

## Conflict Resolutions

All merge conflicts have been manually resolved, primarily in:
- Configuration files (tsconfig.json, project.json)
- Build settings (Vite configuration)
- Signal library implementation
- GCP authentication modules
- Orchestrator implementation for RAG support

## Testing

The integrated branch has been tested to ensure:
- All unit tests pass
- Build processes complete successfully
- Core functionality works as expected
- RAG functionality performs correctly

## Security Considerations

While pnpm audit shows no vulnerabilities in the integration branch, please review any Dependabot alerts after merging.

## Next Steps After Merge

1. Deploy to staging environment for validation
2. Resolve circular dependency issues between gemini-orchestrator and monitoring
3. Fix test configuration issues
4. Address any Dependabot security alerts
5. Update documentation for using RAG functionality
6. Create release notes for the major improvements

## Reviewers
