## Cost Optimization Rules

### Resource Provisioning

1. **Auto-scaling Configuration**

2. **Instance Sizing**
   - Use smallest instance sizes that meet performance requirements
   - Regular performance testing to validate instance sizing
   - Implement vertical scaling for predictable workloads
   - Use horizontal scaling for variable workloads

3. **Geographic Distribution**
   - Deploy resources in GCP asia-southeast1 region to comply with Vietnamese data residency requirements
   - Use multi-region configurations only when necessary for high availability
   - Implement CDN for static assets to reduce data transfer costs

### Data Management

1. **Data Partitioning**
   - Partition BigQuery tables by date for time-series data
   - Use clustering on frequently filtered columns
   - Implement partition expiration policies for historical data
   - Regular review of partitioning strategies based on query patterns

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Implement Memorystore (Redis) for frequently accessed data
   - Configure appropriate TTL values based on data volatility
   - Monitor cache hit ratios and adjust strategies accordingly
   - Use CDN for static assets and frequently accessed content

3. **Storage Lifecycle Management**
   - Implement automated lifecycle policies for Cloud Storage
   - Move infrequently accessed data to Nearline or Coldline storage
   - Archive data that is rarely accessed to Archive storage
   - Regular review of storage access patterns to optimize classes

### Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Budget Management**
   - Set monthly budget alerts at 50%, 80%, and 100% of allocated budget
   - Implement project-level budget controls
   - Regular review of spending patterns and optimization opportunities
   - Automated notifications to finance team for budget threshold breaches

2. **Usage Tracking**
   - Implement detailed usage tracking for all GCP services
   - Regular analysis of usage patterns to identify optimization opportunities
   - Set alerts for unusual usage patterns that may indicate inefficiencies
   - Monthly reporting on cost optimization achievements

3. **Performance vs. Cost Trade-offs**
   - Regular evaluation of performance vs. cost trade-offs
   - Implement performance testing to validate cost optimization decisions
   - Document rationale for all cost-related architectural decisions
   - Quarterly review of optimization strategies

## Service-Specific Optimization Rules

### Compute Services

1. **Cloud Run**
   - Set appropriate memory and CPU allocation based on actual usage
   - Configure concurrency settings to maximize resource utilization
   - Implement request timeouts to prevent long-running processes
   - Use Cloud Run revisions to manage deployments efficiently

2. **Cloud Functions**
   - Optimize function code for cold start performance
   - Use appropriate memory allocation for function requirements
   - Implement efficient error handling to prevent retries
   - Batch processing for high-volume, low-latency requirements

### Storage Services

1. **Cloud Storage**
   - Use appropriate storage classes based on access patterns
   - Implement object versioning for critical data
   - Configure lifecycle policies to automatically transition objects
   - Use signed URLs for secure, time-limited access to private objects

2. **Cloud SQL**
   - Use appropriate instance sizes based on workload requirements

   - Regular review of user access patterns to optimize resources

## Vietnamese Market Considerations

### Local Requirements

1. **Data Residency**
   - All Vietnamese citizen data must be stored in GCP asia-southeast1 region
