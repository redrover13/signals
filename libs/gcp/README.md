# GCP Library (`libs/gcp`)

This library provides minimal stubs and (in legacy/other branches) core logic for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) integration in the Dulce de Saigon platform.

## Overview

- **Purpose:** Exposes utility functions for interacting with GCP services (BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Storage, etc.).
- **Current State:** The main entry point (`src/index.ts`) is a stub. See `docs/legacy/saigon-signals/libs/gcp/README.md` for legacy implementation details.

## Key Files

- `src/index.ts`: Main entry point (currently stubbed).
- `docs/legacy/saigon-signals/libs/gcp/README.md`: Legacy documentation and module breakdown.

## Usage

- Import and extend as needed for GCP integration.
- Replace stubs with real implementations as the platform evolves.

## Next Steps

- Port or re-implement logic from legacy modules as needed.
- Integrate with agent tools and workflows.
