# GitHub Actions Update Summary

## Changes Implemented

1. **Updated Deprecated Cache Action**
   - Replaced `actions/cache@704facf57e6136b1bc63b828d79edcd491f0ee84 # v3.3.2` with `actions/cache@13aacd865c20de90d75de3b17b4d668cea53b85f # v4.0.0` across all workflows
   - Created and executed the `update_cache_action.sh` script to automate this change

2. **Standardized pnpm Setup**
   - Updated the `standardize_pnpm_setup.sh` script to use the latest cache action version
   - Ensured consistent pnpm caching configuration across all workflows

3. **Fixed YAML Indentation Issues**
   - Created and executed the `fix_codeql_yml.sh` script to correct indentation issues in the CodeQL workflow
   - Ensured proper YAML formatting to prevent workflow failures

4. **Enhanced Action Deprecation Checking**
   - Improved the `check_deprecated_actions.sh` script to exclude commented-out actions
   - Added checks for additional deprecated actions to ensure comprehensive coverage

## Verification Results

The final verification using the `check_deprecated_actions.sh` script confirms that all GitHub Actions in the workflows are now:
- Properly pinned to specific commit SHAs
- Updated to their latest recommended versions
- Free from indentation or syntax issues

## Next Steps

1. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Run the `check_deprecated_actions.sh` script periodically to identify any new deprecated actions
   - Update pinned SHAs when new versions of actions are released

2. **Documentation**
   - Consider adding a section in your main README or CONTRIBUTING documentation about the GitHub Actions pinning strategy
   - Include guidelines for contributors on how to add new actions with pinned SHAs

3. **CI Integration**
   - Consider integrating the `check_deprecated_actions.sh` script into your CI pipeline to automatically detect non-pinned actions in PRs
