Vietnamese Food Preferences and Dining Culture

Vietnamese cuisine is characterized by its fresh ingredients, aromatic herbs, and balanced flavors. The Vietnamese dining culture emphasizes communal eating, with shared dishes placed at the center of the table.

Key Preferences:

- Southern Vietnam: Sweet flavors, coconut milk, tropical fruits

Dining Etiquette:
- Use chopsticks and soup spoons
- Wait for elders to start eating
- Finish your rice bowl to show respect
- Tea is commonly served with meals
