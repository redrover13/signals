# Stage 1: Commit your pnpm-lock.yaml

Run this locally:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to your repo:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: add pnpm-lock.yaml for CI consistency"
git push
```

# Stage 2: Check Actions tab after push
- Your new workflow will run on every push/PR to `main`.
- If it fails, check the logs for missing files, dependency issues, or test failures.

---

# Stage 3: Add Lint, Audit, and Secret Scanning (Optional)
- Add jobs for `pnpm lint`, `pnpm audit`, and secret scanning tools (e.g., Gitleaks, Secretlint) after basic build/test is green.

---

# Stage 4: Add Docker and Deploy Steps (Optional)
- Only add Docker build and deploy steps when you are ready to deploy to Google Cloud or another container platform.

---

# Stage 5: Add Google Cloud Secrets
- When deploying, ensure these secrets are set in GitHub:
  - `GCP_PROJECT_ID`
  - `WIF_PROVIDER`
  - `WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
  - (Optional) `NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN`
