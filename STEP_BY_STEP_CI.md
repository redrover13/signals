# CI Setup Guide

## Stage 1: Commit your `pnpm-lock.yaml`

Ensure you have `pnpm` installed globally before running any commands. You can install it using:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Then commit the generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file to your repo:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: add pnpm-lock.yaml for CI consistency"
```

## Stage 2: Check Actions tab after push

- Your new workflow will run on every push/PR to `main`.

## Stage 3: Add Lint, Audit, and Secret Scanning (Optional)

- Add jobs for `pnpm lint`, `pnpm audit`, and secret scanning tools (e.g., Gitleaks scanner, Secretlint tool) after basic build/test is green.

## Stage 4: Add Docker and Deploy Steps (Optional)

- Only add Docker build and deploy steps when you are ready to deploy to Google Cloud or another container platform.

## Stage 5: Add Google Cloud Secrets

- When deploying, ensure these secrets are set in GitHub:
  - GCP_PROJECT_ID
  - WIF_PROVIDER
  - WIF_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  - NX_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN
