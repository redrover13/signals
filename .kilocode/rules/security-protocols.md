# Security Protocols - Dulce de Saigon F&B Platform

## Overview

This document outlines the security protocols and measures implemented for the Dulce de Saigon F&B data platform. These protocols ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data, while complying with industry best practices and Vietnamese data privacy laws.

## 1. Access Control and Authentication

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforced for all access to sensitive systems and data, including GCP console, databases, and internal applications.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Principles of least privilege applied. Users and service accounts are granted only the minimum permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
  - Granular permissions for GCP resources (e.g., Cloud SQL instances, Cloud Storage buckets, BigQuery datasets).
  - Regular access reviews (quarterly) to ensure permissions are up-to-date and appropriate.
- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Utilized for centralized management of user identities and permissions across GCP.
  - Service accounts with fine-grained roles for applications and automated processes.
  - Strong password policies and regular rotation enforced for human users.
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with appropriate timeouts and invalidation mechanisms.

## 2. Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**:
  - All data stored in Cloud SQL, BigQuery, and Cloud Storage is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.
  - Google-managed encryption keys are used by default; customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) are used for highly sensitive data via Cloud KMS.
- **Encryption in Transit**:
  - All data transferred between services (internal and external) and client applications is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
  - Mutual TLS (mTLS) implemented where appropriate for service-to-service communication within the VPC.
- **Tokenization/Masking**: Sensitive data elements (e.g., payment card numbers, specific personal identifiers) are tokenized or masked before storage in development and analytics environments.
- **Data Anonymization/Pseudonymization**: Techniques applied for data used in analytics and reporting to prevent direct identification of individuals.
- **Secret Management**: API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive configurations are stored securely using Google Cloud Secret Manager.
  - Automated rotation of secrets where supported.

## 3. Network Security

- **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network**: Services are deployed within isolated VPC networks with strict firewall rules.
  - **Firewall Rules**: Only necessary ports and protocols are open. Ingress and egress traffic are strictly controlled.
  - **Private Service Access**: Private connectivity between VPC network and Google-managed services (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run) to avoid exposing services to the public internet.
- **Load Balancing**: Google Cloud Load Balancing protects backend services from direct exposure and enables DDoS protection.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF)**: Cloud Armor is utilized to protect web applications (e.g., API Gateway) from common web vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10) and large-scale attacks.
- **Network Segmentation**: Logical segmentation of networks based on sensitivity and function (e.g., production, staging, development environments).
- **VPC Service Controls**: Optionally used to create secure perimeters around sensitive data and resources to mitigate data exfiltration risks.

## 4. Incident Response and Monitoring

- **Security Logging and Monitoring**:
  - **Cloud Logging**: Centralized collection of all operational, audit, and security logs from GCP services and applications.
  - **Cloud Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of system health, performance, and security metrics (e.g., unusual access patterns, policy violations).
  - **Cloud Security Command Center**: Provides a centralized view of security posture, asset inventory, and threat detection.
- **Automated Alerting**: Configured for critical security events (e.g., unauthorized access attempts, data breaches, policy violations, resource misconfigurations).
- **Incident Response Plan**: A well-defined incident response plan is in place, covering detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.
  - Aligned with Vietnamese regulatory requirements for data breach notification (within 72 hours to authorities and affected individuals).
- **Regular Security Audits**:
  - Automated vulnerability scanning (e.g., using Security Health Analytics).
  - Annual third-party penetration testing and security assessments.
  - Internal audits of security configurations and compliance.

## 5. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

- **Security by Design**: Security considerations are integrated into all phases of the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment.
- **Code Review**: All code changes undergo rigorous security code reviews.
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Automated tools integrated into CI/CD pipelines to identify vulnerabilities in source code.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Performed against running applications to find runtime vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning of third-party libraries and dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- **Container Security**: Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities before deployment (e.g., using Artifact Analysis).
- **Secure Configuration Management**: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) is used to define and enforce secure configurations across all GCP resources.

## 6. Compliance and Governance

- **Vietnamese Personal Data Protection Law**: Adherence to all requirements, including consent management, data subject rights, data residency (GCP asia-southeast1), cross-border transfer controls, and DPO appointment.
- **Food Safety Regulations**: Secure handling and storage of food safety related data for traceability and regulatory compliance.
- **PCI DSS Compliance**: If applicable, payment card data handling adheres to PCI DSS standards, including network segmentation, access controls, and regular vulnerability scans.
- **ISO 27001 Alignment**: Information Security Management System (ISMS) aligns with ISO 27001 principles for continuous improvement.
- **Regular Training**: All employees receive mandatory security awareness training and role-specific security training.

## 7. Data Backup and Disaster Recovery

- **Automated Backups**: Regular, automated backups of all critical data (Cloud SQL, Firestore, Cloud Storage) with defined retention policies.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Enabled for transactional databases to allow recovery to any point in time.
- **Offsite Backups**: Critical backups are replicated to a separate GCP region for disaster recovery purposes.
- **Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan**: A comprehensive DR plan is maintained, regularly tested, and includes RTO/RPO objectives for critical services.
- **Immutable Storage**: Use of immutable storage (e.g., Cloud Storage with object versioning and retention policies) to protect against accidental deletion or ransomware.

These security protocols collectively form a multi-layered defense strategy designed to protect the Dulce de Saigon F&B data platform from evolving threats and ensure continuous compliance with all relevant regulations.
