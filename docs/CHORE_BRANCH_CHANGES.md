# Changes from chore/remove-npm-lock Branch

This summary documents the changes we've implemented from the chore/remove-npm-lock branch.

## Package Management Standardization

We've standardized on pnpm as the sole package manager for the project:

1. Removed all `package-lock.json` files from the repository
2. Updated `.gitignore` to exclude all npm and yarn lock files
3. Updated package.json configurations to work optimally with pnpm

## Agent Developer Kit (ADK) Implementation

We've implemented a new Agent Developer Kit (ADK) structure:

1. Created the base ADK directory structure
2. Implemented Vertex AI client for agent integrations
3. Created analytics tracking modules for web, iOS, and Android platforms
4. Added comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and documentation

## Documentation Improvements

Added comprehensive documentation for various aspects of the project:

1. CI/CD Setup Guide
2. Terraform Infrastructure Management Guide
3. Module Federation Configuration Guide

## Main Application Updates

Updated the agents application to use the new ADK structure:

1. Refactored the main.ts file to use the new Vertex AI client
2. Integrated analytics tracking for improved monitoring
3. Added proper error handling and logging

## Next Steps

The following items should be considered for future improvements:

1. Create unit tests for all new ADK components
2. Implement end-to-end tests for the analytics tracking
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline for the new ADK structure
4. Create comprehensive API documentation
5. Implement performance monitoring and optimization

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Standardized Tooling**: Using a single package manager (pnpm) improves consistency and reduces errors
2. **Modular Architecture**: The ADK structure makes agent-related code more reusable and maintainable
3. **Improved Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking across all platforms
4. **Better Documentation**: Clear guides for important aspects of the project
5. **Enhanced GCP Integration**: Streamlined integration with Google Cloud services

## Additional Notes

These changes represent an important step in the ongoing evolution of the Dulce de Saigon F&B Data Platform. By standardizing on modern tools and implementing a more modular architecture, we're setting the foundation for future scalability and maintainability.
