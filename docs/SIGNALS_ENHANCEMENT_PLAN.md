# Signals Library Enhancement Plan

## Current Implementation Analysis

The current signals library implementation wraps Angular signals to provide a reactive state management solution. While functional, there are several areas for enhancement:

### 1. Type Safety Improvements
- Add more specific TypeScript types for signal operations
- Ensure strict null checks are properly handled
- Add better type inference for derived signals

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Implement batched updates to reduce render cycles
- Add memoization for expensive computations
- Optimize subscription management

### 3. Integration Enhancements
- Strengthen module federation configuration
- Improve React hook implementation for better performance
- Add better error handling for async signals

### 4. Documentation
- Expand API documentation with more examples
- Create troubleshooting guides
- Document performance considerations

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Enhancements**
   - Refine type definitions
   - Optimize signal subscription mechanism
   - Implement true batching for updates

2. **Phase 2: Integration Improvements**
   - Enhance React hooks
   - Improve module federation configuration
   - Add SSR support

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Add debugging tools
   - Implement middleware pattern
   - Create DevTools integration

## Build System Integration

- Ensure proper ESBuild configuration
- Fix module resolution for TypeScript
- Enhance testing infrastructure

## Migration Guide

For teams already using an early version of the signals library:

1. Update imports to use the new module paths
2. Replace deprecated methods with their newer counterparts
3. Update React components to use the enhanced hooks

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all core functionality
- Integration tests with React
- Performance benchmarks
- Browser compatibility tests
