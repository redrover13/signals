# GitHub Actions Self-Healing Workflow for Dulce de Saigon
#
# This workflow is triggered by a webhook from Google Cloud Monitoring and
# is responsible for automatically remediating issues in production.
#
# Key Features:
# - Webhook Trigger: Activated by a 'repository_dispatch' event, which can be
#   sent from a Google Cloud Alert.
# - Automated Rollback: If a new deployment is causing issues, this workflow
#   can automatically redeploy the previous stable version.
# - Incident Reporting: Automatically creates a GitHub issue with the details
#   of the alert and the remediation actions taken.
#
# To set up the webhook in Google Cloud Monitoring, see the documentation:
# https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#create-a-repository-dispatch-event
