# PNPM Action Update Summary

## Issue Addressed

Fixed the following error that was occurring during release preparation:

```
An action could not be found at the URI 'https://api.github.com/repos/pnpm/action-setup/tarball/8095b2b9580c96f4e9a8177bec82d79210851024' (CBC0:1BC2BF:8488E:A5BD8:68AFACF3)
```

## Changes Implemented

1. **Updated pnpm/action-setup Reference**
   - Changed from `pnpm/action-setup@8095b2b9580c96f4e9a8177bec82d79210851024 # v4.0.0` to `pnpm/action-setup@b8c4212bc8178b24a6daf5e3da8ac9dd35e3bab9 # v4.0.2`
   - Created and executed the `update_pnpm_action.sh` script to automate this change across all workflow files

2. **Updated Support Scripts**
   - Added the new pnpm action SHA to the `update_additional_actions.sh` script
   - Added a new replacement operation in `update_additional_actions.sh` for pnpm/action-setup

## Files Modified

The script updated pnpm/action-setup references in the following files:
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/ai-models-validation.yml`
- `.github/workflows/license-compliance.yml`
- `.github/workflows/api-docs.yml`

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because the specific commit SHA (`8095b2b9580c96f4e9a8177bec82d79210851024`) for pnpm/action-setup v4.0.0 is no longer available at the GitHub API endpoint. This could be due to various reasons:

1. The repository maintainers may have force-pushed to the repository, changing the commit history
2. The specific commit may have been removed or the repository restructured
3. The tag v4.0.0 may have been moved to point to a different commit

## Prevention Measures

1. **Regular Action Verification**
   - Added pnpm/action-setup to the `update_additional_actions.sh` script to ensure it's included in future updates
   - Consider implementing a periodic check of all pinned action SHAs to verify they're still accessible

2. **Documentation**
   - Updated documentation to include information about this issue and how it was resolved

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the release process to ensure the updated action works correctly
2. Consider implementing an automated test that verifies all action SHAs are accessible as part of the CI process
