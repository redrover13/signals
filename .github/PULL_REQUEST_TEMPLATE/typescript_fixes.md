# TypeScript Infrastructure Overhaul

## 🔍 Problem Statement

The current TypeScript setup in our codebase has several issues that require manual fixes. This PR aims to identify and resolve all root causes of TypeScript errors to prevent them from reoccurring in the future.

### Current Issues:

- Module system inconsistencies (CommonJS vs ES Modules)
- Type definition gaps
- Configuration discrepancies across packages
- Strict type checking failures
- Missing compiler options
- Import/export pattern issues

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution

This PR implements a comprehensive overhaul of our TypeScript infrastructure with a focus on:

1. **Configuration Standardization**: Unified TypeScript configs with proper inheritance
2. **Module System Alignment**: Complete transition to ES Modules
3. **Type Definition Improvements**: Additional types and interfaces
4. **Tooling Enhancements**: Better linting and validation
5. **Automated Fixes**: Scripts to resolve common issues
6. **Developer Experience**: Clearer error messages and documentation

## 📊 Diagnostic Reports

The PR includes detailed diagnostic reports to help identify patterns in type errors:

- **Type Error Distribution**: Analysis of error frequency by category
- **Module Boundary Analysis**: Issues crossing package boundaries
- **Configuration Gap Report**: Identifying inconsistencies in tsconfig files
- **Strict Mode Violations**: Patterns of code that fail in strict mode

## 👨‍💻 Implementation

This PR follows these implementation steps:

1. Initial diagnostics and error categorization
2. Root cause analysis
3. Configuration standardization
4. Type definition improvements
5. Automated fix scripts
6. Manual fixes for edge cases
