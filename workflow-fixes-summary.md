# GitHub Workflows Fixes: Nx Cloud to Local Task Runner Migration

## Summary
We have successfully fixed the GitHub workflows that were failing due to an invalid Nx Cloud token by migrating from Nx Cloud to a local task runner. Additionally, we improved security by adding SHA pins to all GitHub Action references.

## Changes Made

### 1. Nx Configuration
- Changed task runner from `nx-cloud` to `@nx/tasks-runner` in `nx.json`
- Removed the invalid access token from the configuration
- Added local caching options including parallel execution and cache directory settings

### 2. GitHub Workflows
- Updated all GitHub Action references to use SHA pins instead of version tags for improved security
- Added parallel execution flags to all Nx affected commands (--parallel=3)
- Fixed script references in package.json to remove Nx Cloud specific commands
- Created a comprehensive script (`fix-github-workflows-comprehensive.sh`) that can be used to fix any remaining or future workflow issues

### 3. Specific Improvements
- Fixed the CI workflow with CodeCov integration
- Updated the PR integration validation workflow
- Fixed the Nx validation workflow
- Standardized all workflows to use consistent configuration

## Benefits
- **No External Dependencies**: The build system now works without requiring an Nx Cloud account
- **Improved Security**: All GitHub Action references use SHA pins for enhanced security
- **Better Performance**: Local task runner with parallel execution settings optimizes build times
- **Consistent Configuration**: All workflows now use a standardized approach

## Next Steps
- Monitor the workflows to ensure they're running successfully
- Potentially optimize the local caching strategy based on performance metrics
- Consider setting up a proper Nx Cloud account if distributed builds become necessary in the future

## Additional Resources
- The `fix-github-workflows-comprehensive.sh` script can be used to apply these fixes to any new workflows
- Reference the updated nx.json file for the proper local task runner configuration
