# Technical Architecture - Memory Bank

## System Overview

The Memory Bank is built on a modern, cloud-native architecture leveraging Google Cloud Platform services. The system is designed for high availability, scalability, and security while maintaining compliance with Vietnamese data protection regulations.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend Applications
- **Web Dashboard**: React-based interface for business intelligence and analytics
- **Mobile Applications**: Native mobile apps for restaurant staff and managers
- **API Gateway**: RESTful and GraphQL APIs for third-party integrations

### Backend Services
- **Data Ingestion Service**: Handles real-time data from POS systems, inventory management, and customer feedback
- **Processing Engine**: Event-driven processing using Google Cloud Functions and Pub/Sub
- **Analytics Engine**: Real-time analytics powered by BigQuery and Looker
- **Notification Service**: Push notifications and alerts for critical business events

### Data Layer
- **Primary Storage**: Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) for transactional data
- **Data Warehouse**: BigQuery for analytics and reporting
- **Object Storage**: Google Cloud Storage for media assets and backups
- **Cache Layer**: Memorystore (Redis) for frequently accessed data

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker containers orchestrated with Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **Networking**: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with private service access
- **Security**: Identity and Access Management (IAM), Secret Manager for credentials
- **Monitoring**: Cloud Monitoring and Logging for system health and performance

```

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**: POS systems, inventory trackers, and customer apps send data to the API gateway
2. **Validation**: Incoming data is validated and sanitized
3. **Processing**: Validated data is processed through event-driven Cloud Functions
4. **Storage**: Processed data is stored in appropriate data stores (Cloud SQL, BigQuery)
5. **Analytics**: Data is analyzed in BigQuery and visualized through Looker
6. **Notification**: Relevant insights are sent to stakeholders via the notification service

## Security Measures

- End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all system components
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with Vietnamese data protection laws (Personal Data Protection Law)

## Scalability Features

- Auto-scaling container instances based on demand
- Partitioned BigQuery tables for efficient querying
- CDN for media assets and static content
- Load balancing across multiple availability zones
