# Copilot Prompt: Documentation Maintenance

## Purpose

This file is for maintainers and Copilot to periodically review, prune, and update documentation across the repo. It ensures all docs remain relevant, actionable, and not excessive.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Remove or update any doc that references non-existent files, scripts, or workflows.
- [ ] Ensure all Copilot prompt files reflect current pain points and real project quirks.
- [ ] Prune generic advice that is not specific to this codebase.
- [ ] Cross-check all references to scripts, infra, and CI/CD with actual code and configs.
- [ ] Update docs after major refactors, infra changes, or CI/CD updates.
- [ ] Archive or delete deprecated guides and legacy instructions.

## Review Frequency

- **Recommended:** At least once per quarter, or after major project changes.

_Delete this file if a more automated doc review process is adopted._
