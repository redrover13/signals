# PR Management Summary

## Actions Taken

- Successfully merged PR #4 (Nx Cloud Setup) to main
- Deleted local and remote branches for 'feat/nx-cloud/setup'
- Closed PR #6 (Dependabot update) due to major version changes and failing checks
- Took PRs #19, #20, and #21 out of draft status

## Remaining PRs with Conflicts

- PR #19: Security improvements and Vietnamese data privacy compliance
- PR #20: Performance optimization for Vietnamese F&B market conditions
- PR #21: Documentation improvements for Vietnamese F&B market

All three PRs have merge conflicts that require manual resolution. The conflicts involve multiple files and seem to be related to recent changes in the main branch.

## Recommendations

1. **Prioritize PR #19 (Security)**: This PR contains critical security fixes and Vietnamese data privacy compliance. Manual conflict resolution is needed.

2. **Next, address PR #20 (Performance)**: Once security is addressed, this PR will enhance performance for Vietnamese market conditions.

3. **Finally, implement PR #21 (Documentation)**: Complete the PR trilogy with comprehensive documentation.

4. **For the Dependabot PR**: Create a separate task to test the koa upgrade from v2 to v3, as this will require careful testing and validation.

Each PR should be resolved in sequence, taking care to address merge conflicts properly. The conflicts primarily involve README files and Nx cache/workspace files.
