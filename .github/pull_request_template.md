# NX Monorepo Optimization PR

## Description

This PR implements a comprehensive review and optimization of the NX monorepo setup, addressing TypeScript issues, linting rules, and dependency management across all projects.

## Changes

### Project Configuration Enhancements
- Added proper build configurations (production/development) to all projects
- Implemented enhanced caching strategies with named inputs
- Added proper tagging for module boundaries and architecture constraints
- Configured CI-specific test runners with code coverage

### TypeScript Improvements
- Standardized TypeScript configuration across projects
- Fixed type errors and inconsistencies
- Enhanced path mappings for internal dependencies
- Added strict type checking where appropriate

### Dependency Management
- Resolved circular dependencies
- Updated implicit dependency declarations
- Optimized build order through proper dependency configuration

### Linting Enhancements
- Standardized ESLint configurations
- Added custom rules for project-specific needs
- Fixed existing linting issues

## Testing

The following checks have been performed:
- All builds complete successfully
- All tests pass
- ESLint reports no errors
- The dependency graph shows no circular dependencies

## Documentation

Added new utility scripts to:
- Update project configurations
- Check for TypeScript issues
- Analyze dependencies

## Screenshots
